# Direct Download Google Drive Project
*This PHP script is a simple project that I made because of the bored that struck my mind :v , and the usability of this web is just to generate direct download links from the Google Drive site.*

*As per the information above, this is just a simple project, so here I only use the `$ _GET` of the PHP feature and not use an API or Database.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How to use:
*Simple, you just copy `ID of Google Drive` link and execute with your site project.*

drive.google.com/file/d/**1BP55XZethh7yLzw43D7TC-hae9YMkYwC**/view

(the bold text above is a Google Drive ID)

**Example Using:**
- **Original URL:** `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BP55XZethh7yLzw43D7TC-hae9YMkYwC/view`
- **Executing:** `https://yoursite.com/dl/1BP55XZethh7yLzw43D7TC-hae9YMkYwC`

**#NOTE:** Just copy `ID Google Drive` link and execute with your site url project, but don't forget to adding path url **/dl/** before the ID.

`https://yoursite.com/dl/ID-GOOGLE-DRIVE`

*But you can change the url download path {/dl/} with editing file .htaccess* :)
